Samplecat installation
----------------------

Please report any problems at https://github.com/ayyi/samplecat


1 - configure, make, make install.

    The configure script will report missing dependencies.

    For some distributions the list of package dependencies
    can be seen in the Docker files in the test directory.
    Currently Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch are included.
    For example for Ubuntu-18 see the file
    test/ubuntu-18/dependencies

2 - if you are using Mysql, you need to setup the database.
    (Sqlite setup is done automatically)

    The database schema is contained in the file samples.sql
    You can import this by runnig the command:

    mysql -u<USERNAME> -p < samples.sql

3 - running the program will create a default config file 
    (~/.config/samplecat/samplecat) that you should edit with
    your database access information.


If installing directly from the repository rather than from
a tarball, some additional steps are needed before you can
build:

	./autogen.sh
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

If you subsequently need to update the submodules as part of a git pull:

	git submodule foreach git pull origin master
	make clean
