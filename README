Samplecat
=========

http://ayyi.github.io/samplecat/

SampleCat is a program for cataloguing and auditioning audio samples.

SampleCat is available under the GNU General Public License and runs mainly on
GNU/Linux systems. It is written in C and uses the GTK graphics library. 
MySql and Sqlite can be used for the database.

Currently, most basic functionality is in place and working.


building
--------

You *must* download the source code from git as the automatically generated tarball does not contain the `libwaveform` submodule.

```sh
#clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ayyi/samplecat	
cd samplecat

#initialize the libwaveform submodule
git submodule update --init 
#update libwaveform to the latest version
git submodule foreach git pull origin master

```

To update the repository later, run

```sh
	git pull
	git submodule foreach git pull origin master
	make clean
```

Install the build dependencies: `libsndfile1-dev libgtkglext1-dev`  
Run the build process: `./autogen.sh && ./configure.sh`  

usage
-----

* import files or directories using drag and drop.
* if a file is currently mounted, an icon will be shown in the main table. Select Update on the context menu to refresh its status.
* set tags by 1) selecting Edit Tags on the context menu, 2) double clicking the tag area, 3) enter text in the Edit box at the top
  of the window and hit the "Set Category" button.
* to move a file in the filesystem, drag it from the main list to a directory in the directory tree on the left.
* to rename a file in the filesystem, select it, then click on the name.
* auditioning is started by clicking in the waveform view. Jack ports are not created until auditioning is started for the first time.
